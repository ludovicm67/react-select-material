`react-select-material`
=======================

> Added material design to
> [`react-select`](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select)
> package.

Working demo:
https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ludovicm67/react-select-material

Grandly inspired by the code from
https://material-ui.com/demos/autocomplete/#react-select

**But added those features:**
  - French translations
  - Creatable support (just pass `creatable: true` to props)
  - Select component in one single file, so that it can
    be much easier to integrate it to a React project.
