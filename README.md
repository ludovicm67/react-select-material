`react-select-material`
=======================

Added material design to `react-select` package.

Grandly inspired by the code from
https://material-ui.com/demos/autocomplete/#react-select

But added those features :
  - French translations
  - Added Creatable support
  - Select component in one single file, so that it can
    be much easier to integrate it to a React project.
